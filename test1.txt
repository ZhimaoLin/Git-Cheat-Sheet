git branch is used to make a copy of our code that we can edit distinctly from other parts of the project.
example usage:
git branch <my_new_branch>
git checkout <my_new_branch>
git branch -a # to check that we are now on the new branch!

Another command that we learned about was 'git add', it is used to add a file to our project such that we can share with our friends. 

example usage:
git add my_new_file.txt
git status # to list the new files or changes that have been added to your project.

Another command that corresponds to git add is git rm
example usage:
git add my_file.txt
cp my_file.txt my_file2.txt
git add my_file2.txt
git status
git commit -am 'comments'
git push

emacs .gitignore # ignore those files
*~
*.log
